## What is Tapdata?

Tapdata is a live data platform designed to connect data silos and provide fresh data to the downstream operational applications & operational analytics. 

<img width="603" alt="image" src="./assets/tapdata-infra.png">

Tapdata provides two ways to achieve this: Live Data Integration and Live Data Service. 

Live Data Integration is supported by Tapdata's real time data pipelines based on CDC technology, where you can easily connect and capture all the data plus all the changes from disparate data sources, without any custom coding. Tapdata supports many data sources out of box, including dozens of popular databases, you may also use Tapdata's PDK(Plugin Development Kit) quickly add your own data sources. 

Live Data Service is Tapdata's modern approach to the old data integration problem:  streaming data into a centralized data store(currently powered by MongoDB), then serving the data via RESTful API. These APIs are created on-demand, and because they're served by the horizontally scalable, high performant and modern database(instead of source systems), the number of ETL jobs, the performance impact to the source systems, are hence greatly reduced. 

As an alternative, if your data source allows, you may also create data APIs directly from source databases such as Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer etc. 

The term "live" has two meanings:

- When you are using Live Data Integrations, Tapdata will collect data in a "live" mode means it will listen for the changes on the source database and capture the change immediately and send it to the pipeline for processing and downstream consumption. Sometime this is called CDC technology. The data is always fresh and lively throughout the data pipeline. 

- When you are using Live Data Services, the backing data store is lively updated by Tapdata Live Data Integration pipelines and stays up-to-date with the source systems.  


## Primary Use Cases

- Heterogeneous Database Replication such as MySQL to MongoDB or ES

- Real Time Data Pipelines, a better alternative to Kafka based data pipelines

- Event-driven Applications, such as fraud detection or event notifications

- Operational analytics where you need fresh data to make your insights reflect your business's current state



## How It Works

```
# Create Mysql DataSource
> Demo_Mysql = DataSource("mysql","Demo_Mysql").host("demo-mysql").port(3306).username('root').password('password').db('demo')
> Demo_Mysql.save()

# Create MongoDB DataSource
> Demo_Mongo = DataSource("mongodb","Demo_Mongo").uri("mongodb://root:password@demo-mongo:27017/demo?authSource=admin")
> Demo_Mongo.save()

# Create a job that transform the Customer table in Mysql to  MongoDB  and add/set filed 'updated' at the same time.
> Demo_job = Pipeline("Demo_job").readFrom(Demo_Mysql.Customer).js('record["updated"]=new Date() ;return record;').writeTo(Demo_Mongo.Customer-v1)

> Demo_job.start()

# Check the status of job
> show jobs
> monitor job Demo_job

# Check the log of job
> logs job Demo_job limit=5 tail=True 
```
